# How It All Started

Ok So It all initailly started from graphics.

I was never interested in IT nor Software Development but more in story writing, wanting to be an author.

I Dropped My plans of becoming an author being addicted to beauty of games : the graphics, storylines, textures and an over all virtual exploration of the worlds best places.

I researched a lot about Software Engineering, thought of using my creativity along with programming and so setting my current goal to create the most dynamic game of the century.
